# Agent Instructions

Instructions for any agent (Claude Code or otherwise) working in this repo.

## Discovery

If your local environment isn't set up yet, start with [`docs/agent-setup.md`](docs/agent-setup.md) — tool-agnostic setup instructions any agent can follow to bootstrap this repo on a fresh machine.

Before making a change — especially one that touches more than one domain — read:
- [`docs/local-setup.md`](docs/local-setup.md) for how each package (`inference/`, `backend/`, `frontend/`, `eval/`, plus `packages/timeouts/`, the timeouts Frontend and Backend share) is installed and run locally.
- [`docs/project-spec.md`](docs/project-spec.md) for the stack, architecture, and which domain owns what.
- [`docs/engineering-practices.md`](docs/engineering-practices.md) for cross-domain isolation, testing, dev-experience, and the progressive-enhancement order Backend/Frontend get built in.
- [`docs/contracts.md`](docs/contracts.md) for the exact `/analyze` and `/api/chat` schemas. Treat these as the source of truth — if a change requires altering either shape, update `contracts.md` in the same change and flag it, since both sides of the contract depend on it.
- [`docs/tasks.md`](docs/tasks.md) for how work is tracked. See the Backlog.md workflow block below for the moment-to-moment task commands.

## Coding guide

- Write idiomatic code for whichever language/framework you're in, not a generic style forced across all four packages:
  - `backend/`: idiomatic Hono (middleware, `c.json`/`c.text` helpers, route composition) — see [`backend/src/index.ts`](backend/src/index.ts).
  - `inference/`: idiomatic FastAPI + Pydantic (response models, dependency injection) — see [`inference/main.py`](inference/main.py).
  - `frontend/`: idiomatic React/Vite conventions.
  - `inference/` and `eval/`: idiomatic `uv`/`ruff` project conventions (respect `pyproject.toml`, don't hand-roll what `uv` already manages).
- DRY: before adding new logic, check whether it already exists — especially anything touching the `/analyze` or `/api/chat` contracts, where duplicated schema definitions are the most likely place for the two sides to drift.
- No speculative abstractions or unused flexibility — match the scope of the task in front of you.

## Code review

Before considering any non-trivial change done, solicit a critical, adversarial review from a subagent (e.g. this repo's `code-review` skill, or an equivalent independent review pass) rather than self-certifying the diff. Two things are non-negotiable in that review:
- **Test coverage** — new logic needs tests that would actually fail if the logic were wrong, not just tests that exercise the happy path.
- **Human-readable code** — a teammate who wasn't in the room should be able to follow the code without extra explanation.

## Architectural review

Any change that touches architectural matters — the `/analyze` or `/api/chat` contracts in [`docs/contracts.md`](docs/contracts.md), the stack/service topology or sync points in [`docs/project-spec.md`](docs/project-spec.md), the cross-domain isolation guarantees or progressive-enhancement phase order in [`docs/engineering-practices.md`](docs/engineering-practices.md), or introducing a new service, dependency, or deploy target — needs a review from a subagent briefed specifically to look for architectural problems before the change is considered done, in addition to (not instead of) the code review above. Architectural review looks for a different class of issue than code review: hidden coupling between domains, a "Phase N only" claim that something earlier actually depends on, contradictions between two docs describing the same boundary, or an isolation/contract claim that doesn't hold up against how the pieces actually connect. Brief that subagent with the specific docs/files the change touches and ask it to verify claims against the current repo state, not just read the diff in isolation.

## Performance

This runs entirely on free tiers (Cloud Run, Firebase Hosting, Gemini's free quota), so memory and compute efficiency are a design constraint from the start, not a later optimization pass:
- Keep container images small and dependency lists tight — every extra package is cold-start cost on Cloud Run.
- Avoid loading heavyweight resources (models, large lookup tables) eagerly at import time if they can be loaded lazily or scoped to where they're needed.
- Watch for anything that would multiply Gemini API calls or Cloud Run invocations unnecessarily (retries without backoff, polling, redundant tool calls).

**Perf budgets:** TBD — placeholder until `inference/` has a real classifier to measure. Fill in concrete numbers once it exists, and re-check them whenever the model or hosting tier changes.

| Metric | Budget | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `/analyze` p50 latency | TBD | not yet measured |
| `/analyze` p95 latency | TBD | not yet measured |
| Inference container memory ceiling | TBD | not yet measured |
| `/api/chat` end-to-end latency (excluding cold start) | TBD | not yet measured |

## Gemini quota

Gemini's free-tier limits are per project and per model, not per key (see [`docs/local-setup.md`](docs/local-setup.md)), so every key in the team's AI Studio project (`gen-lang-client-0125403786`), production's included, draws on the same quota. A run that uses up a model's daily limit removes that model from production's ladder until the daily reset ([midnight Pacific](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits)); using up all three takes the deployed site down. TASK-45 and TASK-31 both spent production's quota this way.

So local work uses a **personal** AI Studio project instead (`pnpm --filter backend run setup:gemini`, or the `gemini-personal-project` skill), whose quota is only its owner's. The rules below protect the team project and production, and don't apply to runs on a personal project; its per-model limits are still the ones in the table.

Free-tier limits for the models in `GEMINI_MODEL_LADDER` ([`backend/src/config.ts`](backend/src/config.ts)). Update this table when Google changes them; it is the only current copy (experiment records under `docs/experiments/` keep the limits they ran under):

| Model | Requests/min | Tokens/min | Requests/day |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` | 15 | 250k | 500 |
| `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` | 15 | 250k | 500 |
| `gemini-3.8-flash` | 7 | 250k | 20 |

Before any run that calls Gemini with a key from the team's project (an experiment, a script, manual testing against a local Backend):

- **Pin one Flash-Lite model.** Set `GEMINI_MODEL` on a local Backend, or give `createChatFlow` a one-model ladder (as [`docs/experiments/task-47/compare.mjs`](docs/experiments/task-47/compare.mjs) does). Unpinned, a 429 makes the ladder step down to the next model, so the run never sees it and can end up spending `gemini-3.8-flash`, whose 20 requests/day are production's last resort.
- **Estimate requests, not replies.** A reply that calls `analyze_pun` is at least two requests (the tool call, then the answer), and Backend's backoff adds more when Gemini fails. Multiply by prompts and runs, and record the estimate in the task's notes (or tell the user, for manual testing) before starting.
- **Leave half of each day's quota to production.** All of a day's runs together, across the team, stay under half of a model's requests/day. Check the day's usage for the team's AI Studio project (`gen-lang-client-0125403786`) first; if you can't, ask before running. A run that doesn't fit is split across days.
  - **Exception: a whole day, announced.** A run may plan up to about 85% of a model's requests/day (the rest covers production's traffic and retries) if the run's owner has told the team in advance. Once that model runs out, production falls back to the next one on the ladder for the rest of the day. Don't use the exception in the week of the demo.
- **One request at a time, paced.** Never send Gemini requests concurrently, from parallel Backends or parallel variants. Stay at or under two thirds of a model's requests/min (10/min on Flash-Lite).
- **Stop at the first 429** (`RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`). Don't retry or switch models to push through; record what ran and resume another day.

CI and automated tests never call Gemini at all (see [`docs/engineering-practices.md`](docs/engineering-practices.md)).

## Docs alignment

After committing a change, check whether it touched anything the docs describe — a new script, a changed command, a stack swap, a new CI step, a new skill — and diff that against `README.md`, `docs/project-spec.md`, `docs/local-setup.md`, and this file. If any of them have drifted, make a **separate follow-up commit** that updates the docs rather than leaving the mismatch for someone else to discover or folding the fix into the commit that caused it — a distinct commit keeps "why did the docs change" answerable from the log alone.

## Backlog.md Workflow

This project uses Backlog.md for task and project management.

**At the beginning of each conversation in this project, run `backlog instructions overview` before answering or taking action. Re-read it only if you have not read it yet in the current conversation.**

Use the overview to decide whether to search, read, create, or update Backlog tasks.

Before task lifecycle actions, read the matching detailed guide:
- `backlog instructions task-creation` before creating or splitting tasks
- `backlog instructions task-execution` before planning, changing status or assignee, adding a plan or implementation notes, or implementing task work
- `backlog instructions task-finalization` before checking acceptance criteria, writing final summaries, or moving tasks to terminal statuses

Use `backlog <command> --help` before running unfamiliar commands. Help shows options, fields, and examples.

Do not edit Backlog task, draft, document, decision, or milestone markdown files directly. Use the `backlog` CLI so metadata, relationships, and history stay consistent.
