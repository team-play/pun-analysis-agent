"""TASK-19: score candidate senses against their local context and compute the pun margin.

Steps 4-5 + Tier 1 of docs/design/sense-selection.md. Takes the senses
get_candidate_senses() found for one candidate word (TASK-17) plus that
word's predicate/relation slot (TASK-18), and answers two questions:
  1. How well does each sense fit this sentence?      -> score_senses()
  2. Are two clearly different senses both plausible? -> pun_margin()

# dataset's homographic is_pun:true rows (recall) vs. is_pun:false rows'
# candidate-word margins (false-positive proxy, since sense selection only runs
# once detection says is_pun:true), measured through selection.pun_readings()
# (PR #93) so calibration sees exactly what production's other three filters
# (positive runner-up score, no shared WordNet word, dissimilar glosses) let
# through -- an earlier version reconstructed the pipeline directly from
# candidates/context/senses/scoring and measured filters production doesn't
# apply. 1,580 of 1,607 homographic-pun rows (98.3%) had an eligible reading;
# recall below is over those rows (counting the other 27 as misses would put
# 0.05's recall at ~77.2% instead of 78.5%). No threshold cleanly separates
# real puns from ordinary polysemous words: at 0.03, recall is only 62.8%
# (25.8% false positives); 0.05 (78.5% recall, 37.7% false positives) trades
# more false positives for meaningfully higher recall, since a miss here still
# degrades gracefully to Tier 3's llm_fallback rather than a wrong answer.
# Sense-count normalization (margin * sense_count) was tested: correlation is
# weak (-0.244/-0.145 on the negative/positive sets), and it performs roughly
# on par with this flat threshold at matched recall (sometimes marginally
# better, sometimes marginally worse) -- no clear win, so the simpler flat
# constant was kept.
