# Frontend Design — Component Library, Visual Design & State

Complements [`../project-spec.md`](../project-spec.md). Owned by the Frontend domain; consumes the `/api/chat` contract only (see [`../contracts.md`](../contracts.md)) — no dependency on the Inference service, though it renders Inference's `/analyze` result shape inside `analyze_pun` tool results. See [`../engineering-practices.md`](../engineering-practices.md) for the cross-domain isolation/testing/progressive-enhancement rules this doc builds on (the "Development & testing" and "Tool-call visibility" sections below are the frontend-specific mechanics for those rules).

---

## Component library

**Decision:** [assistant-ui](https://www.assistant-ui.com/)'s pre-styled `Thread` component, starting from its default Tailwind/shadcn theming and enhancing it toward a Claude-inspired look via Tailwind theme tokens. No custom semantic CSS layer, no from-scratch stylesheet — customization stays within what the default theme exposes.

> Chat behavior and state (composer, message list, streaming, keyboard handling, tool-call display) come from assistant-ui's pre-styled `Thread`, with a `localStorage`-backed `RemoteThreadListAdapter` (wrapping assistant-ui's own `createLocalStorageAdapter`, not a from-scratch implementation) for thread list + per-thread message history (no server persistence). Sessions always start on a fresh thread; prior threads are available from the list but never auto-resumed. Visual design starts from the default theme and is adjusted toward a Claude-inspired look via Tailwind tokens — simplicity stays the priority over a fully custom design system.

### Why assistant-ui

- Framework-agnostic — not coupled to Next.js, drops cleanly into Vite + TanStack Start.
- The pre-styled `Thread` gives a complete, polished chat UI out of the box — best ratio of effort to "looks nice" for the project timeline, without assembling primitives by hand.
- Handles the hard chat-specific plumbing (streaming, auto-scroll, keyboard shortcuts, tool-call state) so custom work stays scoped to adapters and later theming, not chat mechanics.
- Still built on CSS variables for theming, so adjusting colors/spacing later doesn't mean touching component internals.

### Code highlighting

Code blocks in replies, and the raw `/analyze` response in the `analyze_pun` card, are highlighted by assistant-ui's registry `shiki-highlighter` (`react-shiki`). The agent's code is JSON, so [`purdue-highlighter.ts`](../../frontend/src/components/assistant-ui/elements/purdue-highlighter.ts) builds a fine-grained Shiki highlighter with only the JSON and JSON5 grammars (JSONC and any fence casing map onto them) on the JavaScript regex engine; other languages render as plain code. The full bundle would ship ~300 grammar chunks and a ~230 kB gzipped WASM regex engine. Even trimmed, Shiki is ~56 kB gzipped, so [`lazy-shiki-highlighter.tsx`](../../frontend/src/components/assistant-ui/elements/lazy-shiki-highlighter.tsx) loads it on first use, and shows plain code until then, or if loading fails (e.g. a tab opened before a deploy asking for a chunk that no longer exists). Token colors are Shiki's css-variables theme, set in [`index.css`](../../frontend/src/index.css) from Purdue's brand palette and checked against WCAG AA on both code backgrounds in both themes.

### Alternatives considered and rejected

| Option | Why not |
|---|---|
| Vercel AI Elements | Polished, but docs/CLI assume a Next.js project; would need workarounds under TanStack Start. |
| assistant-ui headless primitives + custom CSS | More visual control, but full custom CSS work isn't needed to reach a Claude-inspired look — the default theme's Tailwind tokens get us there with far less effort. |
| TanStack AI (`@tanstack/ai-react`, `/ui`) | Overlaps assistant-ui's own job (state management + headless UI), not complementary at that layer. Its provider-agnostic adapter layer would only be useful if we needed to swap model providers, which we don't (Gemini via Genkit is fixed). Skipped entirely to keep one library owning chat state. |

## Visual design

Start from assistant-ui's default `Thread` theming to get a working interface quickly, then adjust it toward a Claude-inspired look — calm and content-focused rather than dense or "chat app"-styled — by tuning the existing Tailwind theme tokens rather than overriding or replacing them. Not a literal clone of Claude's interface; describes a target design language, not fixed values. Simplicity stays the priority over a fully custom design system.

- **Palette:** warm neutral base (off-white, not pure white; warm dark gray in dark mode), one restrained accent color for primary actions only. Text hierarchy via weight/opacity rather than added hues.
- **Typography:** clean sans-serif, generous line-height, minimal type scale (body, meta, greeting headline).
- **Layout:** centered content column with a max-width for readable line length; spacing (not borders/shadows) separates message turns; no heavy chat bubbles for assistant responses.
- **Header:** simple — logo + team name, no heavy toolbar.
- **Thread list (sidebar):** minimal, quiet dividers; delete affordance appears on hover rather than always visible.
- **Accent color:** inspired by, not matched to, Purdue's brand palette (Boilermaker Gold `#CFB991`, Black `#000000`) — used subtly as the single accent (active states, primary actions) rather than aiming for full brand fidelity. It reads as a warm gold in the same family as the Claude-inspired warm-neutral palette, so it should sit naturally rather than standing out as a "school color."

## Major components

### 1. Theme
Starts from assistant-ui's default Tailwind/shadcn theme (light/dark mode included out of the box), tuned toward the Claude-inspired palette/typography above via theme tokens.

### 2. Chat
- **Greeting state:** vertically centered, generous negative space, short headline, prominent input field. Transitions to the chat view once the first prompt is sent.
- **Chat state:** message list scrolls, input field docks to the bottom as a persistent rounded field.
- **Session behavior:** always starts on a fresh thread on load — no auto-resume of the last active thread.
- **Export/reset:** the open thread's sidebar entry has a "Copy as JSON" button (for eval) that reads the runtime's live messages, not the copy in `localStorage`. Only the open thread has a button, since it's the only thread whose messages are loaded. [`export-thread.ts`](../../frontend/src/lib/chat/export-thread.ts) defines the shape: `{exportedAt, threadId, messages: [{role, content: [text | tool-call]}]}`, where a `tool-call` part's `result` is the `/analyze` response unchanged and is left out when the call never got one. Reset is the sidebar's New Thread button: it opens a fresh thread on the greeting and leaves the previous one in the list. Clearing the open thread in place would leave its saved history behind, and the next message would add a second root to it.

### 3. Thread list
- Backed by a `localStorage`-based `RemoteThreadListAdapter` (list, create, rename, archive, delete) — assistant-ui's own `createLocalStorageAdapter`, wrapped with a thin `window.localStorage` adapter rather than reimplemented from scratch; no server persistence.
- Per-thread messages persisted via the matching `ThreadHistoryAdapter` the same factory provides, also `localStorage`-backed.
- A thread is only written to the stored list once the first message is sent (guarded via the adapter's `initialize()`), to avoid accumulating empty "New Chat" entries on every page load.
- Individual threads deletable from the list.
- **Schema drift across phases:** Phase 1 threads persist text-only message parts; Phase 2 adds `tool-call` parts to the shape `ThreadHistoryAdapter` writes. Persisted threads aren't version-tagged, so a thread saved under Phase 1 and reopened after Phase 2 ships is only guaranteed to render if the adapter treats missing tool-call parts as absent rather than malformed — worth an explicit check when Phase 2 lands, or a "clear local storage" note for dev environments if not.

## Development & testing

Per [`../engineering-practices.md`](../engineering-practices.md)'s isolation rule, Frontend must be fully buildable and testable without a live Backend. assistant-ui's `ChatModelAdapter` is the seam that makes this possible: it's the one place that knows how to reach `/api/chat`, so it's also the one place that needs swapping to remove that dependency.

- **Stub adapter.** A `StubChatModelAdapter` implementing the same `run()` interface as the real one, returning canned responses instead of calling `/api/chat`. At minimum it needs two fixtures: a plain-text-only stream (Phase 1 shape) and a text-plus-`tool-call` stream (Phase 2 shape, once that lands — see "Tool-call visibility" below). Local dev picks between the stub and a real running Backend via a build-time env flag (`VITE_CHAT_ADAPTER=stub|live`, plus `VITE_BACKEND_URL` and an App Check debug token for `live` — see [`../local-setup.md`](../local-setup.md)); CI's tests and unit tests always use the stub; the deployed site builds with `live` (see [`../local-setup.md`](../local-setup.md)).
- **CORS.** Pointing the `live` flag at a real Backend crosses origins even locally (frontend on `:5173`, backend on `:8080` per [`../local-setup.md`](../local-setup.md)) — Backend needs CORS middleware enabled for that flag to work at all, and the same applies to the deployed pairing (Firebase Hosting calling Cloud Run). Tracked as Backend-side work, not Frontend's, but flagged here since it blocks this flag either way.
- **Unit test scope.** Component rendering (greeting → chat transition, message rendering, loading/error states), the `RemoteThreadListAdapter` and `ThreadHistoryAdapter` logic against a fake/in-memory `localStorage`, and the custom `ChatModelAdapter`'s Genkit-stream-event parsing logic ([`genkit-flow-stream.ts`](../../frontend/src/lib/chat/genkit-flow-stream.ts)), exercised against streams recorded from the real Backend rather than a live one. None of this requires a running Backend, Inference service, or Gemini quota, so it runs safely in CI on every push/PR ([`.github/workflows/test.yml`](../../.github/workflows/test.yml)), alongside the existing lint job.
- **Framework: Vitest + React Testing Library.** Already wired up — `frontend/`'s `pnpm test` runs `vitest run` (config in [`../../frontend/vite.config.ts`](../../frontend/vite.config.ts)'s `test` block, jest-dom matchers registered in [`../../frontend/src/setupTests.ts`](../../frontend/src/setupTests.ts)). Chosen over Jest for native Vite/ESM config reuse (one config object, no separate transform setup) and over `node:test` (Backend's choice, per [`../engineering-practices.md`](../engineering-practices.md)) because component tests need a DOM (`jsdom`) and React-aware queries, which Testing Library provides directly.
- **Layout regression check (manual).** The thread must scroll inside its own viewport, never the page. assistant-ui sizes the last turn's scroll reserve from the viewport's height (`turnAnchor="top"`), so if the viewport isn't height-bounded by its ancestors, the reserve grows the viewport and the viewport grows the reserve, without end (TASK-33). [`App.tsx`](../../frontend/src/App.tsx) bounds it with `h-dvh` on `SidebarProvider` and a `flex-1 overflow-hidden` wrapper around `Thread`. jsdom computes no layout, so no unit test catches a regression here; until TASK-34 adds a browser test, re-run this check after touching the app shell, `SidebarInset`, or `ThreadRoot`/`ThreadPrimitive.Viewport`, or bumping `@assistant-ui/react` (the reserve logic lives there):
  1. `pnpm dev` with `VITE_CHAT_ADAPTER` unset (stub adapter), send "hello there", wait for the reply, send "hello again", wait for the reply.
  2. In the browser console, run this expression twice, a second apart:
     `[document.querySelector('[data-slot=aui_thread-viewport]').getBoundingClientRect().height, innerHeight, document.body.scrollHeight]`
  3. Pass: both runs return the same numbers, the viewport height is `innerHeight` minus the 56px header, and `document.body.scrollHeight` equals `innerHeight`. On the broken layout the first number climbs by thousands of pixels between runs.
- **Fixture sharing.** The stub's fixtures should track the real `/api/chat` shape in [`../contracts.md`](../contracts.md) closely enough that swapping the stub for the real adapter doesn't require touching component code — confirmed for Phase 1 in TASK-8 (the UI ran unchanged against the real Backend), and for Phase 2 in TASK-10 against TASK-9's Backend. The stub yields assistant-ui parts directly, so it doesn't exercise the stream parsing: what keeps that matched to Backend is the byte-for-byte recordings in [`recorded-genkit-streams.ts`](../../frontend/src/lib/chat/fixtures/recorded-genkit-streams.ts), which the parser and live-adapter tests replay. Mention a trigger word to reach each Phase 2 state in the stub ([`stub-chat-model-adapter.ts`](../../frontend/src/lib/chat/stub-chat-model-adapter.ts)'s `SCENARIOS`): `pun`, `fallback`, `undetermined`, `not a pun`, `fail` (the reply fails before the tool result), `slow` (the call runs for 30 s, to try stop) and `error`.

## Tool-call visibility

Since Genkit isn't one of assistant-ui's built-in framework adapters, the Backend↔Frontend link always goes through a **custom `ChatModelAdapter`** — this isn't Phase-2-only infrastructure. Even Phase 1's plain-text Gemini proxy needs it: `run()` has to parse Genkit's stream events into assistant-ui's message parts before any real backend (not just the stub) can be wired up at all, per [`../engineering-practices.md`](../engineering-practices.md)'s progressive-enhancement plan.

What *is* Phase 2 work is extending that same adapter to also parse `tool-call` events — it only becomes buildable once Backend's `analyze_pun` tool exists (or, per the isolation rule above, once a fixture standing in for its stream shape exists):

- Requires a small translation layer: parsing Genkit's tool-call stream events into assistant-ui's `{ type: "tool-call", toolName, toolCallId, args }` part shape (plus the eventual result).
- assistant-ui tracks call status (`running` → `complete`) natively, so the UI can show the `analyze_pun` tool call live as it fires and resolves — either via assistant-ui's default tool-call rendering, or a custom "Generative UI" component registered for that specific tool name if we want bespoke styling for it.

## Open items

- ~~Identify which of the default theme's Tailwind tokens (colors, spacing, radii) to override to reach the Claude-inspired palette/layout, once the interface is running against real content.~~ — resolved in TASK-6.1: `frontend/src/index.css`'s `:root`/`.dark` blocks retune `--background`/`--foreground`/`--primary`/etc. directly via oklch values, verified visually in both color schemes.
- Settle on the exact accent shade (a muted gold in the Boilermaker Gold family, not the literal brand hex) — a candidate shade is in place (`--primary` in `frontend/src/index.css`) and was eyeballed against the warm-neutral background in both themes, but a formal contrast-ratio (WCAG) check hasn't been done yet.
- ~~Confirm the Genkit stream event shape for tool calls~~ — resolved: sync point 3 is closed in [`../contracts.md`](../contracts.md), which specifies the `toolRequest`/`toolResponse` chunk shapes and the `ref`-based rule the adapter's parsing logic uses to pair each result with its call.
- The shared stub-fixture format (so Frontend's stub and Backend's Phase 2 fixture don't drift apart) is still open — see [`../engineering-practices.md`](../engineering-practices.md)'s open items.
- ~~The one test that exists today (`frontend/src/App.test.tsx`) only smoke-tests the default Vite starter page — it gets replaced once the real greeting/chat UI lands, not extended.~~ — resolved in TASK-6: `App.test.tsx` now covers the greeting/chat transition, message rendering, loading state, tool-call rendering, error state, and thread-list persistence behavior.
- ~~CORS middleware on Backend (needed for the `live` adapter flag and for the deployed Firebase↔Cloud-Run pairing) isn't implemented yet~~ — resolved in TASK-7: `hono/cors` in [`../../backend/src/app.ts`](../../backend/src/app.ts), allowlisting the local dev origin and the Firebase Hosting origin.
