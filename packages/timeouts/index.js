// The timeouts that make up /api/chat's waiting chain, from Frontend asking
// for an App Check token to Cloud Run cutting the request off. They depend on
// each other across the Frontend/Backend deploy boundary, so they live here
// and nowhere else: Backend, Frontend and deploy-backend.yml read them from
// this file, and tests/relationships.test.js fails if a change to one breaks
// another. docs/contracts.md describes what each one bounds.
//
// Plain JavaScript (with index.d.ts for its types), not TypeScript: the
// backend image runs this file from node_modules, where Node refuses to
// strip types.
//
// None of these can be overridden by environment variables. If one ever is
// (say, for local testing), refuse the override on Cloud Run the way
// backend/src/config.ts refuses APP_CHECK=off, so production always runs on
// the values here.
//
// Changing a value: a change that lengthens Backend's maximum silence must
// reach Frontend before Backend (docs/engineering-practices.md).
