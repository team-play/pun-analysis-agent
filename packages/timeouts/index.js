// for an App Check token to Cloud Run cutting the request off. They depend on
// each other across the Frontend/Backend deploy boundary, so they live here
// and nowhere else: Backend, Frontend and deploy-backend.yml read them from
// this file, and tests/relationships.test.js fails if a change to one breaks
// another. docs/contracts.md describes what each one bounds.
//
// Plain JavaScript (with index.d.ts for its types), not TypeScript: the
// backend image runs this file from node_modules, where Node refuses to
// strip types.
//
// None of these can be overridden by environment variables. If one ever is
// (say, for local testing), refuse the override on Cloud Run the way
// backend/src/config.ts refuses APP_CHECK=off, so production always runs on
// the values here.
//
// Changing a value: a change that lengthens Backend's maximum silence must
// reach Frontend before Backend (docs/engineering-practices.md).

 * pause mid-reply. Without this limit, a Gemini call that went quiet was
 * bounded only by the user giving up, or by Cloud Run's request timeout
 * (TASK-42). analyze_pun's wait on Inference never counts against it: tools
 * run between model calls, so INFERENCE_TIMEOUT_MS bounds that wait
 * instead.
 *
 * Measured for the ladder's Flash-Lite rungs only (TASK-32,
 * docs/experiments/task-32): over 50 replies to TASK-38's prompts, the
 * longest silence in 92 attempts that answered was 14.8 s, a pause between
 * two chunks of a gemini-3.1-flash-lite reply that then finished normally.
 * gemini-3.1-flash-lite's slowest first chunk was 7.0 s (it thinks at
 * MEDIUM), and gemini-3.5-flash-lite never went quiet for more than 1.3 s.
 * 30 s is about twice that longest silence. A limit that's too short fails
 * healthy replies, and one pause in 47 gemini-3.1-flash-lite attempts says
 * it happens, not how often or how long it gets, so the margin stays
 * generous; 15 s would have left that reply 0.2 s to spare.
 *
 * Don't lower it until gemini-3.8-flash, the ladder's last rung, is
 * measured too (TASK-50): TASK-45 saw it go past 30 s before its first chunk, and
 * one limit covers every rung. Raising it shrinks RETRY_BUDGET_MS and
 * lengthens MAX_SILENCE_MS for Frontend to wait out (TASK-44).
