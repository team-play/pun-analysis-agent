## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
docs/design/sense-selection.md leaves the Tier 1 margin threshold (when two candidate senses count as close enough to signal a pun) unset until Eval runs it against real data. Use the eval dataset's homographic, is_pun:true rows to calibrate that threshold once TASK-19's scoring exists.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Margin threshold is calibrated against the homographic/is_pun:true subset of the eval dataset
- [ ] #2 The chosen threshold and calibration methodology are recorded in docs/design/sense-selection.md's open questions section
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Code review (test coverage + human-readable code) done per AGENTS.md's Code review section
- [ ] #2 Architectural review done if this touches contracts.md, project-spec.md topology, or engineering-practices.md isolation/phase order, or adds a service/dependency/deploy target
- [ ] #3 Docs checked for drift (README.md, project-spec.md, local-setup.md, AGENTS.md); follow-up commit made if any changed

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
From TASK-19 (2026-09-28): two placeholders in inference/scoring.py need calibrating, MARGIN_THRESHOLD (0.1) and GLOSS_DISTINCT_THRESHOLD (0.5, used when lexfiles can't separate senses: Wiktionary senses and adj.all adjectives). With 0.1, polysemous verbs scored by Lesk showed margins of 0.02-0.08 in the code review's samples (need, use, lose, die, go, stand), so they'd all read as puns; the threshold likely needs to be much lower or margin-relative. /analyze doesn't expose the margin, and inference/ and eval/ are separate uv projects, so calibration needs a way to get margins out (e.g. a script in inference/ that runs the SemEval subset, or a debug field).

From TASK-19's review (Yai, 2026-09-29): Lesk margins shrink as a word gains senses. Sentence-vs-gloss cosines bunch in a narrow band, and the runner-up is the best of every other-category sense. Real model, no seeded slot, ordinary non-pun sentences: window ("She opened the window to let in air.") 8 senses, margin 0.043; book ("He read the book on the train.") 10, 0.083; bank ("We had a picnic on the river bank.") 10, 0.041; tire ("Long meetings tire me out.") 4, 0.046. All four read as puns at 0.1. table/chair/interest (6/5/7 senses) 0.18/0.25/0.36 and dough ("She rolled the dough flat.", 2 senses) 0.43 did not. TASK-21 planning saw the same: "She rolled the dough flat." gave rolled 0.014 and flat 0.023. Calibration should check whether the margin needs to account for the number of senses. MARGIN_THRESHOLD only affects embedding-Lesk: selectional-preference scores are 0 or 1, so their margins are too. Calibrate on signals with PunSignal.method == "embedding_lesk".
