/**
 * A model middleware that makes sure each tool call the model makes has a
 * `ref`, so Frontend can tell which toolResponse answers which toolRequest
 * (docs/contracts.md). Gemini can call analyze_pun several times at once,
 * and Genkit then returns every result in one chunk, in the order the
 * calls *finished*. A toolResponse doesn't carry its input, so the ref is
 * the only way to match results to calls. Genkit copies a toolRequest's
 * `ref` onto its toolResponse, so a ref on every request is enough.
 *
 * gemini-flash-latest on the Developer API supplies its own ids (e.g.
 * "call_56935", seen in TASK-9's smoke test), which are kept. This is the
 * safety net for a model or API version that leaves them out, which the
 * Gemini plugin allows for (it sets `ref` only when Gemini sends an id).
 *
 * Refs are "0", "1", ... in the order the model made the calls, across
 * every model turn of one reply (create one middleware per reply). The
 * streamed chunks and the final message get the same numbers because they
 * list the same calls in the same order. A call can also be streamed in
 * pieces (every piece but the last marked `partial`, then merged into one
 * call in the final message), so the pieces of one call share its ref. A
 * call that already has a ref keeps it and isn't counted.
