// Flash-Lite for its free tier and availability; TASK-43 added 3.1), then
// Flash as a last resort. Flash has the least of both (free-tier limits:
// AGENTS.md's Gemini quota section), and TASK-38 and TASK-45 saw it
// overloaded, out of quota and stalling. Three stalls (MODEL_STALL_LIMIT_MS
// each) on any model spend the reply's whole RETRY_BUDGET_MS before it can
// step down, so
// the top rung goes to a model that hasn't been seen stalling. Each rung
// names a fixed version rather than a -latest alias, so two rungs can't turn
